# ICPC Practice Repository

This repository is used to practice for the ICPC / Brazilian Programming Contest by solving **official problems from past contests** and keeping a structured record of what was solved and how. The focus is on repetition, consistency, and tracking progress over multiple years.

The repository contains:
- problems organized by year and letter
- official input/output test cases
- a simple local runner to execute solutions against all tests
- a table to track solved problems and techniques used

## Usage

### Running a single problem

```bash
icpc run 2020 A
```

Runs all tests for problem **A** from year **2020**.

### Running all problems from a year

```bash
icpc run 2020 all
```

Runs all available problems for that year.

## Creating a shell alias

To avoid typing the full path every time, it is recommended to create an alias.

### Temporary (current terminal session)

```bash
alias icpc="./bin/icpc"
```

### Permanent (recommended)

Add one of the following lines to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
alias icpc="/full/path/to/icpc/bin/icpc"
```

After reloading the shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc   # or ~/.bashrc
```

You can then run commands from anywhere:

```bash
icpc run 2021 C
```

## Solved problems tracking

Use the table below to track which problems were solved and record the main idea behind each solution.

Suggested fields:
- **Algorithm**: e.g. greedy, DP, BFS, segment tree, math
- **Complexity**: e.g. O(n), O(n log n)
- **Notes**: pitfalls, tricks, or observations
